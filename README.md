# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**This dataset contains data about bank marketing. The point of the dataset tells whether an person ends up subscribing to a term deposit. Using this data to create a classification model, we can predict whether a person is likely to subscribe to a term deposit.**

**We tested two ways to create classification models using AzureML. The first was using linear regression with parameters tuned by Hyperdrive. The second was using AutoML which automated model creation and parameter selection. The best preforming model was an AutoML Voting Ensamble with an accuracy of 91.8%. The Hyperdrive logistic regression model scored close with a 91.3%.**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
